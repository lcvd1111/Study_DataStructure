The overall flow chart for Prim's Algorithm is well explained in /0053~~~/memo/notetaking_0053_0.jpg image file.
The most important things are below two things.

1. Check whether distance toward neighborhood is longer than previously recorded distance or not, before the enqueueing.
   If it is, you should not enqueue this node&edge to priority queue.

2. Check whether Dequeued node is already in Minimum Spanning Tree or not.
   If it is, you must dequeue again.
